#1 - Find the version you want to upgrade to.
#You can only upgrade one minor version to the next minor version
sudo apt-get update
apt-cache policy kubeadm
TARGET_VERSION='1.32.1-1.1'



#What version are we on? 
kubectl version 
kubectl get nodes



#First, upgrade kubeadm on the Control Plane Node
#Replace the version with the version you want to upgrade to.
sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm
sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=$TARGET_VERSION
sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm



#All good, check to see if the version is updated
kubeadm version



#Run upgrade plan to test the upgrade process and run pre-flight checks
#Highlights additional work needed after the upgrade, such as manually updating the kubelets
#And displays version information for the control plan components
sudo kubeadm upgrade plan v1.32.1  #<---this format is different than the package's version format



#Run the upgrade, you can get this from the previous output.
#Runs preflight checks - API available, Node status Ready and control plane healthy
#Checks to ensure you're upgrading along the correct upgrade path
#Prepulls container images to reduce downtime of control plane components
#For each control plane component, 
#   Updates the certificates used for authentication
#   Creates a new static pod manifest in /etc/kubernetes/mainifests and saves the old one to /etc/kubernetes/tmp
#   Which causes the kubelet to restart the pods
#Updates the Control Plane Node's kubelet configuration and also updates CoreDNS and kube-proxy
sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.32.1  #<---this format is different than the package's version format


#Look for [upgrade/successful] SUCCESS! Your cluster was upgraded to "v1.xx.yy". Enjoy!



#Next, Drain any workload on the Control Plane Node
kubectl drain c1-cp1 --ignore-daemonsets



#Now update the kubelet and kubectl on the control plane node(s)
sudo apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl 
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=$TARGET_VERSION kubectl=$TARGET_VERSION
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl



# Reload and restart the systemd unit since their configs files have changed
sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
sudo systemctl status kubelet



#Check the update status
kubectl version
kubectl get nodes



#Uncordon the node
kubectl uncordon c1-cp1 


#Upgrade any additional control plane nodes with the same process.
